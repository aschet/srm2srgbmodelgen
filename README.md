# Beer Color SRM/EBC to sRGB Model Generator

This Python program, which is best run within a Jupyter Notebook, takes sRGB colors created by a spectral model as input and prints a set of polynomial equations as output. These equations enable you to translate a beer color rating in SRM/EBC into sRGB colors. Constants within the program allow you to customize the generated output.

Please be aware of:
- The color appearance of beer is depending on the environment, especially the transmission path a.k.a. glass diameter.
- SRM/EBC color measurements are performed at a single wavelength (430 nm). Thus, they convey no full color information. A reconstructed color will always be a "guess".
- The sRGB color space is not large enough to faithfully render beer colors.
- While models generated by this program may provide you with good results, it would be better to implement the referenced algorithm.

## Example Model

Follow the comment instructions. To use this model for EBC color ratings, convert by srm=ebc/1.97. If you are interested in a full implemented of the spectral model, please visit take a look at the [Ã˜l farve](https://github.com/aschet/olfarve) repository.

```
# SRM to sRGB model, multiply outputs by 255 and clip between 0 and 255
# 5 cm transmission, CIE 1931 2 Degree Standard Observer, D65 illuminant
r=1.0288e+00+srm*(-3.4275e-02+srm*(4.0949e-04+srm*(-1.4355e-06)))
g=9.9429e-01+srm*(-9.3762e-02+srm*(3.5191e-03+srm*(-5.3307e-05)))
b=1.0027e+00+srm*(-3.4068e-01+srm*(5.5363e-02+srm*(-5.2704e-03)))
```
